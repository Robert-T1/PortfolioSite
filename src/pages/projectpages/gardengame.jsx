            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p className={styles.descrptionText}>
            Garden Game is a peaceful farming simulation.
             Start with a few tomato seeds and carefully tend your gardenâ€”dodging turtles and harvesting crops at peak ripeness.
             Sell your produce at the market to earn profit and expand your collection. With 26 unique seeds to discover and grow, 
             can you collect them all?
            </p>
