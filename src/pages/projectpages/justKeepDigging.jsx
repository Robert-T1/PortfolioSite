            <p className={styles.descrptionText}>
                Just Keep Digging is an open-world action-adventure mining simulator.
                Play as John in Bodie, a company mining town. Meet the weekly profit quota or face termination. Use extra company coins to upgrade your gear, dig deeper for rarer resources, and uncover ancient fossils and ruined structures. Beware of dangerous cave dwellersâ€”bring a weapon along with your pickaxe.

            <h4>Reflections</h4>
            <p className={styles.descrptionText}>
                At the time of writing this, Just Keep Digging has an expected release in May, on Steam. 
                Just Keep Digging is the most ambitious project I've worked on to-date, with almost 1 year of development and just under 1,000 hours of development time as well writing over 11,000 lines of code, Just Keep Digging has been a huge project for me as an individual to take on, both in its complexity (procedural generation, saving state huge open world, enemy AI, GUI, effects system, ect) and time commitment.
